    """Perform DBSCAN clustering from vector array or distance matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array or sparse (CSR) matrix of shape (n_samples, n_features), or \
            array of shape (n_samples, n_samples)
        A feature array, or array of distances between samples if
        ``metric='precomputed'``.
    eps : float, optional
        The maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered
        as in the same neighborhood.
    min_samples : int, optional
        The number of samples (or total weight) in a neighborhood for a point
        to be considered as a core point. This includes the point itself.
    metric : string, or callable
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string or callable, it must be one of
        the options allowed by :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances` for
        its metric parameter.
        If metric is "precomputed", X is assumed to be a distance matrix and
        must be square. X may be a sparse matrix, in which case only "nonzero"
        elements may be considered neighbors for DBSCAN.
    metric_params : dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.
        .. versionadded:: 0.19
    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, optional
        The algorithm to be used by the NearestNeighbors module
        to compute pointwise distances and find nearest neighbors.
        See NearestNeighbors module documentation for details.
    leaf_size : int, optional (default = 30)
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or cKDTree. This can affect the speed
        of the construction and query, as well as the memory required
        to store the tree. The optimal value depends
        on the nature of the problem.
    p : float, optional
        The power of the Minkowski metric to be used to calculate distance
        between points.
    sample_weight : array, shape (n_samples,), optional
        Weight of each sample, such that a sample with a weight of at least
        ``min_samples`` is by itself a core sample; a sample with negative
        weight may inhibit its eps-neighbor from being core.
        Note that weights are absolute, and default to 1.
    n_jobs : int, optional (default = 1)
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.
        If ``-1``, then the number of jobs is set to the number of CPU cores.
    Returns
    -------
    core_samples : array [n_core_samples]
        Indices of core samples.
    labels : array [n_samples]
        Cluster labels for each point.  Noisy samples are given the label -1.
    Notes
    -----
    For an example, see :ref:`examples/cluster/plot_dbscan.py
    <sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_dbscan.py>`.
    This implementation bulk-computes all neighborhood queries, which increases
    the memory complexity to O(n.d) where d is the average number of neighbors,
    while original DBSCAN had memory complexity O(n).
    Sparse neighborhoods can be precomputed using
    :func:`NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors_graph
    <sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors_graph>`
    with ``mode='distance'``.

            ``metric='precomputed'``.
        sample_weight : array, shape (n_samples,), optional
            Weight of each sample, such that a sample with a weight of at least
            ``min_samples`` is by itself a core sample; a sample with negative
            weight may inhibit its eps-neighbor from being core.
            Note that weights are absolute, and default to 1.
